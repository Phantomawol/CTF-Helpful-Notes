# CTF-Helpful-Notes
Storing things that would help on CTFs. 
NOTE: I do not own these tools nor do I claim to. This is just a place to store tools I find useful to use on CTF events. If you are unsure how to use a tool listed below or one you found: Remember to use the -h command on a tool or read the man page.

<h2>Tools</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Nmap: Network scanning</li>
	<li>Binwalk: Analyzing, reverse engineering, & extracting firmware images</li>
	<li>Recon-ng: Osint tool you link API keys to get information from social media sites on a company or person. NOTE: You will need to add your own API keys as they do not provide that.</li>
	<li>Netcat: Unix tool that reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocol. [Taken from Kali Linux's tool page]</li>
	<li>CherryTree: Note taking tool that is built into Kali linux. Useful to keep notes for your CTF. Worth installing on any linux system.</li>
	<li>hashid: Run this to check a hash that you obtain to tell what it is. This will help to avoid having to bruteforce with hashcat/johntheripper.</li>
	<li>pdfinfo: Allows you to see all of the metadata on a PDF</li>
	<li>exiftool: ExifTool is used to read and write metadata in various file types, such as JPEG images [Description taken from TryHackMe]. Also helps with OSINT as you can take the coordinates of the image to track down where it was taken.</li>
	<li>QRCodeRaptor - This allows you to upload QR codes or use your built in camera to scan a QR Code. It's a safe way to scan vs using your phone. Can be used in a real life case or CTF.</li>
	<li>strace - (edit this later with details)</li>
</ul>
