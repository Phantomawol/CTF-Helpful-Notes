# CTF-Notes - Storing tools/links that would help on CTFs. WIP

<h4>NOTE: I do not own these tools nor do I claim to. This is just a place to store tools I find useful to use on CTF events. If you are unsure how to use a tool listed below or one you found: Remember to use the -h command on a tool or read the man page. Links provided at the time are to the legitmate website, but always take precautions when clicking.</h4>
