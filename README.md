# CTF-Helpful-Notes - Storing things that would help on CTFs. WIP

<h4>NOTE: I do not own these tools nor do I claim to. This is just a place to store tools I find useful to use on CTF events. If you are unsure how to use a tool listed below or one you found: Remember to use the -h command on a tool or read the man page. Links provided at the time are to the legitmate website, but always take precautions when clicking.</h4>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Network scanning tools</li>
		<ol>Nmap: https://github.com/nmap/nmap</ol>
	<li>Binwalk: Analyzing, reverse engineering, & extracting firmware images</li>
	<li>Recon-ng: Osint tool you link API keys to get information from social media sites on a company or person. NOTE: You will need to add your own API keys as they do not provide that.</li>
	<li>Netcat: Unix tool that reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocol. [Taken from Kali Linux's tool page]</li>
	<li>Note Taking Applications - Linux/Windows/Apple </li>
		<ol> <b>CherryTree - Linux</b>: Note taking tool that is built into Kali linux. Useful to keep notes for your CTF. Worth installing on any linux system. https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/releases</ol>
		<ol> <b>Obsidian - Windows/Apple/Linux</b>: https://obsidian.md/</ol>
	<li>hashid: Run this to check a hash that you obtain to tell what it is. This will help to avoid having to bruteforce with hashcat/johntheripper.</li>
	<li>pdfinfo: Allows you to see all of the metadata on a PDF</li>
	<li>exiftool: ExifTool is used to read and write metadata in various file types, such as JPEG images [Description taken from TryHackMe]. Also helps with OSINT as you can take the coordinates of the image to track down where it was taken.</li>
	<li>QRCode Tools</li>
		<ol><b>QRCodeRaptor</b> - This allows you to upload QR codes or use your built in camera to scan a QR Code. It's a safe way to scan vs using your phone. Can be used in a real life case or CTF. https://qrcoderaptor.com/</ol>
	<li>strace - (edit this later with details)</li>
	<li>C2 tools (Note: I do not own these, but use them for CTFs when needed. Found these out from someone and going to try them in an upcoming CTF if able.):</li>
		<ol>Sliver (No GUI) - https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver</ol>
		<ol>Havoc (Has GUI) - https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc</ol>
</ul>
